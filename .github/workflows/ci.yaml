# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed for a Node.js application.
# It performs the following tasks on every commit:
# 1. Runs unit tests.
# 2. Performs SonarQube scanning.
# 3. Builds a Docker image.
# 4. Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
# 5. Pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry.
# 6. Updates the Kubernetes deployment file with the new Docker image tag.
